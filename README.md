# Imbalanced-Neural-Network-Credit-card-fraud-dataset-
There are two models created in this code notebook in which one in trained on unbalanced dataset and then roc_auc_score is viewed and again the model is trained on given trained weights and for this also roc_auc_score is viewed and noticed that for the second one the score is better. Hence I got to know how unbalaced dataset can cause efficiency issues.

Dataset used is credit card fraud detction which is binary class either fraud is done or not.
